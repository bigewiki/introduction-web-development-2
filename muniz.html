          Hello class, I'm<span style="background-color:#FFFCDD">
            Edward Muniz
          </span>
          . I'm a father to a 7-year-old daughter and a husband. My wife and I
          will celebrate our first wedding anniversary in March! Below I've
          added a picture of me and my little one in front of the Endeavour
          shuttle at the California Science Center in Los Angeles.

          I'm studying Web Development and aspiring to be become a front-end
          developer. I work in the field for a web hosting company. My
          department mostly deals with website migrations for customers moving
          their websites to us or between accounts. Currently, I'm working with
          a development team to automate some of the easy work and make life
          easier for our customers. My role is build an API (application
          programming interface) to support some of the moving pieces. Think of
          an API as a channel of communication between two things such as a
          user-interface and a database.

        <p>
          My journey has earned me a bit of experience with Javascript, ReactJS,
          Linux, Bash Scripting, MySQL, PHP, and WordPress.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm confident I'll learn a lot from this class that I can apply to my
          work. I can benefit from learning more about the design/planning
          process, best practices, accessibility, and overall leveling up my
          ability to apply HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll share with everyone a WordPress site I built a while back for my
          Psychology 101 final:
          <a href="https://dont.psycho-analyze.me/" target="_blank"
            >dont.psycho-analyze.me</a
          >. Using WordPress isn't as code intensive as writing raw HTML and CSS
          (though in some parts I did) and programming everything to behave
          correctly. The site might look nice (at least I think so) it's mostly
          because of the tools under WordPress that I used to do it and some
          takeaways from building a few sites with our design team.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you aren't familiar with WordPress I suggest checking it out! It's
          very popular, fairly easy to use, and open source. WordPress controls
          <a

            target="_blank"
            >a third of the web</a
          >. I go to the local, annual WordCamp every year. They host one in
          practically every major city.
        </p>

          I'm a novice wood worker, most of what I build is made of 2x4s and
          serves as patio furniture. I'm leveling up to build nicer furniture
          that I won't be embarrassed to have indoors. Because I love building I
          also enjoy starting new projects to apply whatever new language,
          library, or concept I'm learning, I sometimes even
          <i>finish</i> these projects!
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy PC games as well, though I try and keep my gaming casual for
          the sake of having the time for adulting and school. Ideally I would
          kick this habit but I may sneak in a game of Starcraft II when my wife
          isn't looking. I recently got into playing DND with a group of
          coworkers. We try and meet every other week or so
